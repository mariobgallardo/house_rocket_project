# INSIGHT PROJECT - House Rocket

![alt text](https://fasthomes.org/public/img/fast/house-for-sale.jpg)

This project aims to assist a real estate company to maximize it's proffits by indicating a selection of properties based on the best conditions, so the company could buy and sell them. 

By using Streamlit, the company can visualize the information on different formats, such as Tables, Graphs and Maps. Check the visualization app bellow:

## 1. House Rocket
### 1.1. Business Understanding:

House Rocket company belongs to the real estate sector and work with buying and selling properties. It has been consolidated by making good decisions using the technology on your favor.

The House Rocket's CEO wish to maximize the company profits by finding great opportunities, therefore this case will provide insights so the company can find these opportunities. 

The company's strategy is to buy good properties with low prices to sell them later with higher prices. The greater the difference, the bigger the company's profit. However, there are many features influencing their prices and we don't have enought people to analyze this dataset manually. 

### 1.2. Business Question:
In order to take it, it will be provided 2 lists indicating the best properties to buy and the best period to sell them, as well as a visualization app. 
The two main questions behind the project are:
1) What are the properties that house rocket should buy, and for what price?

2) Once purchased, when it's the best time to sell it and for what price?

### 1.3. Data Overview:
Our data has been obtained through the link bellow:

### 1.4. Business Assumptions:
Considering the business understanding during the exploratory data analysis, some assumptions were made in order to create a few insights. The assumptions are listed bellow:

* Values (11 and 33) on column bathrooms were considered outliers, adjusting their values based on properties with similar square foot living.
* Values above 950.000 on column sqft_lot were considered outliers, adjusting their values based on properties with similar price 
* Duplicate "ID" values were removed, considering the newest ones
* For properties condition's scale we considered: 'bad' for condition < 3, 'regular' for condition = 3 and 'good' for condition > 3.
* The year's season has a great influency on our prices. By research, spring season was considered the best period to sell properties
* The features with the greatest impact on properties price were location (zipcode) and condition, the reason why both were used on properties sellection
* The business team assumed that properties bouth out of spring season and with a price bellow the region's median price shall be sold with 30% over the purchase price and properties bouth on spring season and with a price bellow the region's median price shall be sold with 10% over the purchase price.

## 2. Planning Solution
### 2.1. Data analysis:
After collecting the data, it was necessary to treat and explore it. On these steps, data was cleaned, transformed (types) and analysed with the assistance of descriptive statistics in order to identify outliers. 

* Created Features:
  * Median Price: Median price obtained based on each zipcode
  * Status: Represents if the property should be bought or not
  * Season: Season when property was purchased
  * Sell Price: Price that property shall be sold, based on the season
  * Profit: Represents the difference between sell price and price

* Descriptive Statistics:

### 2.2. Solving Business Questions:
The entire project was made to create the two final lists that we were suposed to provide to the CEO of House Rocket, as well as our visualization app.
To do so, a few steps were followed, as shown bellow:

1) What are the properties that house rocket should buy, and for what price?
* Groupby all properties by region (zipcode)
* Find the median price of each zipcode
* Merge the median price on the original dataset, according to the zipcode
* Assumed that all properties that had a price bellow the median price and that were not in a bad condition should be bought
* The response was setted on the column 'status'
* Export to excel a list of properties to buy

2) Once purchased, when it's the best time to sell it and for what price?
* Created a new column named 'season' where it was filled up according the purchase date of each property of the buy list
* Considered spring as the best season to sell
* Properties that were bought on spring should be sold with an increase of 10% and properties bought on other seasons should be sold with an increase of 30% 

### 2.3. Visualization:
The purpose of the visualization app is to help us to find insights by providing tables, maps and graphs which align with the two filters ('zipcode' and 'condition'). 

The first two tables refers to the properties recommendation, being the first one a purchase list and the second one a selling list, including the best period and the profit gain. 

By filtering, it's possible to see on the Region Overview section two maps, such as portfolio density (indicating the location and features of each property) and a profit density (indicating the amount of profit by region).

## 3. Insights and Hypothesis
### 3.1. Insights:

There are two groups of properties that were used on our analysis. The first one involves only the sellected properties, based on the conditions mentioned before, and it was used to show how the features were distribuited among them in order to maximize the profit, as shown bellow:

| Feature       |	Status         |	Count   |	(%) Properties|	Profit        |	(%) Profit |
|---------------|:--------------:|:-------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:----------:|
| zipcode       |	98052          |	281     |	2.67          |	34,242,265.5  |	3.45       |
|	condition     |	regular        |	6717    |	63.94         |	624,718,053.0 |	63.02      |
|	grade         |	average design |	10502   |	99.97         |	990,555,853.6 |	99.93      |
|	floors        |	1              |	6595    |	62.77         |	582,450,946.8 |	58.76      |
|	bedrooms      |	3              |	5752    |	54.75         |	525,161,157.7 |	52.98      |
|	bathrooms     |	1              |	3041    |	28.94         |	231,043,200.7 |	23.30      |
|	waterfront    |	no             |	10496   |	99.91         |	990,330,606.0 |	99.91      |
|	year_built    |	1977           |	237     |	2.25          |	24,225,403.6  |	2.44       |

The (%) Properties indicates the percentage of properties included on the specified status of the feature. The (%) Profit indicates the profit obtained by selling these properties compared to the total possible profit.

It's possible to verify that properties with average design (grade) and without waterfront are the best properties to work with, based on their (%) profit. If we compare to our Profit Density Map, the properties with waterfront have a bigger "mean" profit, not the biggest "sum" of profit. Besides this, properties near water are much more expensive on average, which means that our profit would be concentraded on a few houses, increasing our business risk.

### 3.2. Hyphotesis:

Different from the first analysis, the second one involves the whole dataset (without outliers), which was used to verify a few hiphothesys seeking to find insights as well.

| Hyphotesis                                                                                                 |	Validation |	Business application  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------:|:---------------------:|
| H1 - Good condition's properties with waterfront view are 50% more expensive than without waterfront view  |	False      |	They are much more expensive, which makes them not a viable option                   |	
|	H2 - Properties with building year before 1955 are cheaper on average                                      |	False      |	Propertie's price are building year independent    |	
|	H3 - Properties without basement have a square footage of the land space 15% bigger than properties with it|	True       |	Company should invest on properties without basement as they have a bigger square footage  |	
|	H4 - The propertie's price growth YoY (year over year) it's 10%                                            |	False      |	There's no difference beyond the two years    |	
|	H5 - Properties with more than 3 bathrooms had a MoM growth of 5%                                          |	False      |	The monthly increase was less (1,64%) than 5% which does not makes them attractive to invest    |	
|	H6 - Properties with 2 or more floors are 40% more expensive on average than the others                    |	True       |	Company should invest on properties with less than 2 floors   |	

## 4. Financial Outcome

Based on the list of recommended properties to buy and considering the best season to sell them, the scenario of our best profit obtained is showned bellow:

| Purchase cost   |	Sales price      |	Profit         |
|-----------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
|4,079,586,744.00 |	5,070,803,197.60 |	991,216,453.60 |

## 5. Conclusion

The main purpose of this project was to provide a sellection of properties to buy and the best season to sell them, as well as answer a few business questions in order to find new insights. Although our objective was reached, a visualization app was provided to assist the business team on the search of new insights and opportunities, and also provides them the propertie's features and profit according the used filters, helping the team to identify the features that makes properties more attractive to buy and sell operations. 
It's also important to remember that as more data is collected, more analysis needs to be done.
