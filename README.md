The company's strategy is to buy good properties with low prices to sell them later with higher prices. The greater the difference, the bigger the company's profit. However, there are many features influencing their prices and we don't have enought people to analyze this dataset manually. 

### 1.2. Business Question:

The two main questions behind the project are:
1) What are the properties that house rocket should buy, and for what price?

2) Once purchased, when it's the best time to sell it and for what price?

### 1.4. Business Assumptions:
Considering the business understanding during the exploratory data analysis, some assumptions were considered in order to create a few insights. The assumptions are listed bellow:

* Values (11 and 33) on column bathrooms were considered outliers, adjusting their values on properties with similar square foot living. 
* Duplicate "ID" values were removed, considering the newest ones
* For properties condition's scale we considered: 'bad' for condition < 3, 'regular' for condition = 3 and 'good' for condition > 3.
* The year's season has a great influency on our prices. By research, summer season was considered the best period to sell properties
* The business team assumed that properties bouth out of summer season and with a price bellow the region's median price shall be sold with 30% over the purchased price and properties bouth on summer season and with a price bellow the region's median price shall be sold with 10% over the purchased price.









This project also wants to validate some hypothesis through data analysis:

H1) Properties with a good condition and waterfront view are 50% more expensive on average than properties with good condition but without waterfront view;

H2) Properties with building year before 1955 are cheaper on average;

H3) Properties without basement have a square footage of the land space 15% bigger than properties with it;

H4) The propertie's price growth YoY (year over year) it's 10%;

H5) Properties with 3 bathrooms have a MoM growth of 15%.

H6) Properties with 2 or more floors are 40% more expensive on average than the others
